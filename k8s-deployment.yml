metadata:
  name: #what it will be called externally
  labels:
    app: #what it will be called internally
    tier: #where it sits it the app
spec: #spec for the deployment (essentially a replica set)
  replicas: #number of pods thiat match
  selector: #what is going to be connected
    matchLabels: #how it finds another in a pod
      app: #the actually name of what will be connected to
  minReadySeconds: #determins how long there should be a pause before next step in rolling upates is completed
  strategy: #used to describe the method in which updates will be deployed. Done via rollout command. Note you can also slect history to see what has been done.
            #These updates happen when the tempalte is updated. Note, In flight updates are droped if a new update is placed
    rollingUpdate: #most common method of updating a K8's cluster 
      maxSurge: # the highest amount you can go over the replicas number (can be a number or a percentage) 
      maxUnavailable: #the highest amount you can go below the replicas number
  template: #template of the pod
